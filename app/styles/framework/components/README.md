# COMPONENTS

These are chunks of UI. More specific pieces than Objects. A component probably won't appear in too many different contexts.

This is where a lot of the custom cosmetics get set. Most of the other style layers where setting things up so this layer could give the site its particular "feel" without worrying about layout.
