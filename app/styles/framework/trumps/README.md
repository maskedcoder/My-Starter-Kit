# TRUMPS

Trumps are at the top of the specificity food-chain. Nobody overrides trumps. Trumps override everyone else. This is on purpose. Trumps are here to target extremely specific elements and make sure they work right. Remember how you're not supposed to use `!important`? That doesn't apply here.

## Examples

Examples of trumps might be:

- Accessibility helpers (so `.visually-hidden` stays visually hidden)
- Visibility helpers (to avoid, "Aargh! Why is `display: none` not working?")
