# BASE

These are the base style rules. All selectors are element selectors, if possible.

This layer sits above the Generic layer. Generic gets HTML elements to act similar on all browsers. Now we begin to tell those elements what to do.

## Example

An example of what Base styles might be is typography. Base styles would set the default font(s) for elements, and then specify the font-size of `p`, `h1`, `h2`, etc.
